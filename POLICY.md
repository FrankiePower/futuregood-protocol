# 📜 FutureGood Protocol - Yield Routing Policy

## Executive Summary

FutureGood Protocol captures value from yield tokenization and redirects it to public goods funding via Octant's dragonRouter. This document outlines how yield is allocated, routed, and donated to maximize impact while maintaining security and transparency.

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

**Enable users to donate future yield to public goods while preserving their principal.**

Traditional charitable giving requires sacrificing assets today. FutureGood allows users to commit *tomorrow's yield* to public goods while keeping *today's principal*, creating a sustainable funding mechanism that aligns long-term incentives with public goods funding.

---

## 💰 Revenue Model

### Source
**Yield Token (YT) sales from users who choose "Public Goods Mode"**

When users call `mintPtAndYtForPublicGoods()`, they receive:
- **Principal Tokens (PT)**: Kept by user, redeemable 1:1 for underlying asset at maturity
- **Yield Tokens (YT)**: Sent to PublicGoodsYieldHook for auto-sale

### Mechanism
**Automated YT → YBT swaps on Uniswap V4**

The PublicGoodsYieldHook contract:
1. Receives YT tokens from users who opt into public goods mode
2. Accumulates YT until `MIN_ROUTE_AMOUNT` threshold (1e18)
3. Automatically triggers routing after swaps in the YT/YBT Uniswap V4 pool
4. Routes YBT proceeds to YieldRouter for deployment

### Destination
**Multi-protocol deployment across Aave (40%), Morpho (30%), Spark (30%)**

YieldRouter splits incoming YBT across three yield-generating strategies:
- **AaveYieldDonatingStrategy**: Deploys to Aave ATokenVault
- **MorphoYieldDonatingStrategy**: Deploys to Morpho Vaults V2
- **SparkYieldDonatingStrategy**: Deploys to Spark Protocol

### Beneficiary
**100% of yield → Octant dragonRouter**

All three strategies inherit from Octant's `BaseStrategy` and are configured with:
- `donationAddress` = dragonRouter (Octant's public goods funding address)
- `enableBurning` = false (dragonRouter shares cannot be burned to cover losses)

When strategies generate profits, they mint shares exclusively to dragonRouter, not to depositors.

## 📊 Allocation Strategy

### Multi-Protocol Split

| Protocol | Allocation | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Aave** | 40% | Largest TVL ($20B+), most battle-tested, highest liquidity |
| **Morpho** | 30% | P2P optimization often yields better APY, innovation leader |
| **Spark** | 30% | MakerDAO backing, institutional-grade security, conservative risk |

### Mathematical Verification

The 40/30/30 split is implemented as:
```solidity
uint256 toAave = (amount * 4000) / 10000;  // 40%
uint256 toMorpho = (amount * 3000) / 10000; // 30%
uint256 toSpark = amount - toAave - toMorpho; // Remaining 30% (avoids rounding dust)
```

**Test Evidence**: `test_depositSplits40_30_30` runs 256 fuzzing iterations, verifying exact allocation across all input amounts.

### Why This Split?

#### 1. **Risk Diversification**
No single protocol risk. If one protocol experiences issues (hack, insolvency, liquidity crisis), 60-70% of funds remain safe.

#### 2. **Yield Optimization**
- **Aave**: Steady, predictable yields from largest lending market
- **Morpho**: Higher yields via P2P matching when available
- **Spark**: Conservative yields from MakerDAO-backed protocol

Combined, these protocols provide a balanced risk/reward profile optimized for long-term public goods funding.

#### 3. **Liquidity Management**
- **Large deposits**: Aave handles bulk with deep liquidity
- **Medium deposits**: Morpho P2P optimization shines
- **Conservative tranche**: Spark provides stability

#### 4. **Ecosystem Alignment**
Supporting multiple protocols demonstrates:
- Protocol neutrality (not captured by single protocol)
- Commitment to DeFi ecosystem health
- Sophisticated risk management

## 🔄 Operational Flow

### Phase 1: User Donation
```
User → YieldSplitter.mintPtAndYtForPublicGoods(marketId, 100 USDC)
├─ User receives: 100 PT tokens (redeemable for 100 USDC at maturity)
└─ Hook receives: 100 YT tokens (for public goods)
```

### Phase 2: YT Liquidation
```
Uniswap V4 Pool (YT/USDC)
├─ LP provides liquidity: YT ↔ USDC
├─ Hook accumulates YT from public goods deposits
└─ afterSwap hook triggers automatic routing when threshold met
```

### Phase 3: Yield Deployment
```
YieldRouter receives USDC from YT sales
├─ 40 USDC → AaveYieldDonatingStrategy → Aave ATokenVault
├─ 30 USDC → MorphoYieldDonatingStrategy → Morpho Vault
└─ 30 USDC → SparkYieldDonatingStrategy → Spark Pool

All strategies configured with donationAddress = dragonRouter
```

### Phase 4: Yield Generation
```
Strategies accrue yield from lending
├─ Aave: Earns interest from borrowers
├─ Morpho: Optimizes with P2P matching
└─ Spark: Earns from MakerDAO-backed lending

Keeper calls strategy.report() periodically
├─ Strategy calculates profit
├─ Mints profit shares to dragonRouter
└─ User shares remain unchanged (no profit to depositors)
```

### Phase 5: Public Goods Funding
```
dragonRouter accumulates strategy shares
├─ Represents claim on deployed capital + accrued yield
├─ Octant community votes on allocation to public goods projects
└─ Funds distributed to approved projects
```

## 👥 User Experience

### Traditional Mode
**Function**: `mintPtAndYt(marketId, amount)`

```
User deposits 100 USDC
├─ Receives: 100 PT (principal)
├─ Receives: 100 YT (yield rights)
└─ User keeps both, free to trade/sell/hold
```

**Use Case**: Users who want to speculate on yield, manage their own PT/YT positions, or provide liquidity.

### Public Goods Mode
**Function**: `mintPtAndYtForPublicGoods(marketId, amount)`

```
User deposits 100 USDC
├─ Receives: 100 PT (principal) → User keeps
└─ YT goes to hook → Auto-sold → Public goods
```

**Use Case**: Users who want to donate future yield while preserving principal (tax-efficient charitable giving, DAO treasury management, protocol grants).

### Redemption (Both Modes)
**Function**: `redeemPtAndYt(marketId, amount)` (after maturity)

```
User redeems 100 PT
├─ Burns 100 PT tokens
├─ Receives 100 USDC back
└─ Full principal returned (no loss)
```

**Guarantee**: PT tokens are always redeemable 1:1 for underlying asset at maturity, regardless of YT disposition.

## 📈 Economic Example

### Scenario: 365-Day Market, 5% APY

| Timepoint | Event | Amount | Recipient |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Day 0** | User deposits | 100 USDC | - |
| Day 0 | User receives PT | 100 PT | User |
| Day 0 | Hook receives YT | 100 YT | Hook |
| Day 0 | YT auto-sold | ~5 USDC | YieldRouter |
| Day 0 | Deployed to Aave | 2 USDC | AaveStrategy |
| Day 0 | Deployed to Morpho | 1.5 USDC | MorphoStrategy |
| Day 0 | Deployed to Spark | 1.5 USDC | SparkStrategy |
| **Day 1-365** | Yield accrues | ~0.25 USDC | dragonRouter |
| **Day 365+** | User redeems PT | 100 USDC | User |

### Net Result
- **User donated**: ~5.25 USDC (5 USDC YT value + 0.25 USDC yield)
- **User kept**: 100 USDC principal (100% preserved)
- **Public goods received**: 5 USDC immediate + 0.25 USDC perpetual yield
- **Effective donation rate**: ~5.25% (but principal preserved!)

### Comparison to Traditional Donation

**Traditional donation of 5 USDC:**
- User loses 5 USDC permanently
- Public goods receive 5 USDC one-time
- No ongoing yield generation

**FutureGood donation (100 USDC in public goods mode):**
- User loses 0 USDC principal (gets it all back at maturity)
- Public goods receive 5 USDC immediately + perpetual yield
- Total impact: ~5.25 USDC + ongoing yield forever

**Tax Implications** (consult tax advisor):
- Traditional donation: May be deductible, but principal lost
- FutureGood: Principal preserved, may enable different tax treatment
- Potential for "double benefit": Tax efficiency + principal preservation

## 🔒 Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Emergency Shutdown
Each strategy has independent emergency admin who can:
- Call `shutdown()` to stop new deposits
- Call `emergencyWithdraw()` to recover funds
- Does NOT affect PT redemption (always honored)

### 2. User Principal Protection
- PT tokens are always redeemable 1:1 at maturity
- YieldSplitter holds sufficient YBT to honor all PT redemptions
- Even if strategies lose money, PT holders are made whole

### 3. Multi-Protocol Diversification
- No single point of failure
- If one protocol fails, 60-70% of funds preserved
- Independent security audits across protocols

### 4. Transparent Accounting
All operations emit events:
- `Deposited(user, amount, aaveShares, morphoShares, sparkShares)`
- `Withdrawn(user, amount, aaveShares, morphoShares, sparkShares)`
- `YieldAutoRouted(poolId, marketId, ybt, amount, ...)`

### 5. dragonRouter Protection
- `enableBurning = false`: dragonRouter shares cannot be burned to cover user losses
- Public goods funding is never diluted to make users whole
- Losses (if any) absorbed by strategy reserves, not dragonRouter

## 🎯 Governance & Parameters

### Immutable Parameters (Cannot Change)
- **Allocation ratios**: 40/30/30 (hardcoded in YieldRouter)
- **Strategy addresses**: Set at deployment (immutable)
- **Hook permissions**: afterInitialize + afterSwap (immutable)

### Mutable Parameters (Can Update)
- **MIN_ROUTE_AMOUNT**: Hook threshold for routing (default: 1e18)
- **autoRouteEnabled**: Per-pool toggle (can disable)
- **poolToMarketId**: Pool-market mappings (can add new pools)

### Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Permissions | Address |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Management** | Update strategy params, set fees | Set at deployment |
| **Keeper** | Call report(), tend() | Set at deployment |
| **Emergency Admin** | shutdown(), emergencyWithdraw() | Set at deployment |
| **Hook Owner** | setPoolMarketMapping(), toggleAutoRoute() | Hook deployer |

### Future Governance Considerations
For production deployment, consider:
- **DAO governance**: Transfer ownership to DAO multisig
